# University-Thesis-Smart-Home
This smart home application was made for my university thesis. It consists of a Blazor Webassmbly web application, that serves as the smart home hub, and a prototype smart device. The prototype smart device conists of a Raspberry Pi running a Python script of the device logic and a basic RGB light circuit connected to it. The smart home system is designed to be deployed on a local network.The devices communicate with the hub through Wi-Fi, using the WebSockets protocol. Users can control the smart devices through the web browser of any device. Extra features, like user accounts and switching between a light and a dark theme, are included.
